## Setup
This example still has some rough edges around authentication. They'll be fixed soon, so in the mean time follow these steps to run this example. Sorry for the mess!

0. Create a new [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/).
0. Clone this repo.
0. Open `FireChat-Swift.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
0. Edit [`MessagesViewController.swift`](FireChat-Swift/MessagesViewController.swift) and change `swift-chat.firebaseio.com` to point to your Firebase.
0. Edit [`LoginViewController.swift`](FireChat-Swift/LoginViewController.swift) and change `swift-chat.firebaseio.com` to point to your Firebase.
0. On your emulator or iOS device, go to Settings, scroll down to the accounts section (which contains Twitter, Facebook, Flickr and Vimeo), select Twitter -> Add Account. Register one account. 
0. If the previous step didn't work, install the Twitter app and sign in to at least one account.
